Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical learning** and **practical experience** |. We have **partnered** with various MSME clients to create a unique **learning environment** |. Our **offline office** and **academy** will provide a hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI devices like Redaxa and Jetson Nano |. We will be working on **real-world projects**, such as **traffic enforcement**, utilizing **radar technology**, including 2D, 3D, and 4D radar |. This launch is not just about **learning**, but about **experimentation** and **innovation** |. **Learners** will **collaborate** with **industry experts** and **business owners** to develop AI solutions that **address real-world problems** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time data** and **low-level ML architecture solutions**, leveraging LLMs and AI to drive **impact** |. We **research**, **implement**, **iterate**, and **refine** our approach to ensure we are **solving meaningful problems** |. If you're **interested**, please reserve your spot by clicking the link and **joining our community** |. We will be sharing **fellowship programs**, **articles**, and **case studies** in the coming weeks |.
