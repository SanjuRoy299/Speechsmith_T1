Hello, my name is **Anushka Nandhan** | and I am here to discuss the fascinating topic of **pandas** and their unique relationship with **bamboo** |. As we know, **pandas** are primarily herbivores, and **bamboo** makes up a significant portion of their diet |. In fact, **pandas** can eat up to **26-33 kilograms** of **bamboo** shoots and leaves per day |. This remarkable adaptation allows them to thrive in their native habitats |.
