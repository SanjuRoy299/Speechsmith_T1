Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical learning** and **practical experience** |. Through our **partnerships** with various MSME clients |, we invite **professionals** and **industry experts** to visit our **state-of-the-art facility** and experience firsthand how we leverage cutting-edge AI devices like Redaxa and Jetson Nano to drive **innovation** in traffic enforcement using **advanced radar technology**, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar |. This launch is not just about another **learning experience** |, but about **hands-on experimentation** where learners will **collaborate** with business owners, guided by our **expert mentors**, to develop **practical solutions** using AI that **drive real impact** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time data**, which we use to develop **low-level ML architecture solutions** for traffic enforcement and call center analytics, while also **leveraging** LLMs and AI to drive **innovation** |. We **embrace** a **culture of experimentation**, where we **research**, **iterate**, and **refine** our approaches to **solve complex problems** |. If you're **interested**, please reserve your spot by clicking the link and **joining our community** |. We'll keep you updated on our upcoming **fellowship programs**, **informative articles**, and **in-depth case studies** |.
