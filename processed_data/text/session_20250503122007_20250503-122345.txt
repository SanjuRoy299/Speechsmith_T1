Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical** learning and **practical** experience |. We have **partnered** with various MSM clients to create a platform where **professionals** and **industry experts** can come together to **advance** their careers in AI |. Our **state-of-the-art** offline office and academy will showcase our work with **cutting-edge** AI devices, such as Redaxa and Jetson Nano, and demonstrate our applications in **traffic enforcement** using **radar technology**, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar |. This launch is not just about another learning experience, but about **hands-on** experimentation, where learners will **collaborate** with business owners, **experts**, and **peers** to develop innovative AI solutions that **address real-world problems** |. Our **core strength** lies in **real-time data** analysis, particularly in traffic enforcement and call center analytics, where we employ **low-level ML architecture solutions** and leverage LLMs and AI to drive **meaningful outcomes** |. We are committed to a cycle of **research**, **iteration**, and **continuous improvement** |. By doing so, we are **redefining** the way we approach problem-solving, and we invite you to be a part of this **journey** |. If you're **interested**, please reserve your spot by clicking the link, and stay **updated** on our upcoming **fellowship programs**, **articles**, and **case studies** |. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to **connecting** with you soon.
