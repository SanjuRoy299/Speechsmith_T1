Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to launch Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical** learning and **practical** experience |. We have **partnered** with various MSMEs to create a unique learning environment |. Our **vision** is to bring together **professionals**, **industry experts**, and individuals eager to **advance** their careers in AI |. We invite you to visit our **state-of-the-art** offline office and academy |, where you can witness our work with cutting-edge AI devices like **Radxa** and **Jetson Nano** |. Our focus is on **traffic enforcement** using **radar technology**, including 2D, 4D, and 3D **radar** |. This launch is not just about another learning experience |; it's about **hands-on experimentation** |. Our learners will **collaborate** with business owners, guided by our **experts**, to develop AI solutions that **address real-world problems** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time data** and **low-level ML architecture** solutions, leveraging LLMs and AI to drive innovation |. We **research**, **implement**, **learn from failures**, and **iterate** |. This approach allows us to **refine** our understanding of what we're building, why we're building it, and how it **impacts** the world around us |. If you're **interested**, please reserve your spot by clicking the link and **registering** |. Stay **connected** with us for updates on our upcoming **fellowship programs**, **articles**, and **case studies** |. Thank you for your attention |.
