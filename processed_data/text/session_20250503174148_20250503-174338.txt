Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to launch Grade AI Academy |, which **bridges** the gap between **theoretical learning** and **practical experience** |. We have **partnered** with various MSME clients | to create an **immersive learning environment** |. Our **offline office** and **academy** offer a unique opportunity for **professionals** and **industry experts** to collaborate with our **team** and work with cutting-edge AI devices like Redaxa and Jetson Nano |. We are **pushing the boundaries** of **radar technology**, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar, to **drive innovation** in traffic enforcement |. This launch is not just about **learning** |, but about **hands-on experience** where learners will work with business owners, **experts**, and **real-world use cases** to build **meaningful solutions** with AI |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time data** and **low-level ML architecture solutions**, leveraging LLMs and AI to **drive impact** |. We **research**, **experiment**, **learn from failures**, and **iterate** | to stay at the **forefront** of AI innovation |. If you're **interested**, reserve your spot by clicking the link and **staying updated** on our upcoming **fellowship programs**, **articles**, and **case studies** |.
