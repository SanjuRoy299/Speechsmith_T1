The reality is that it's not the **Ivy** League universities that are most affected, but rather the **smaller** US institutions that provide degrees to the **majority** of students from India and America |. These universities are facing a far **greater** threat from the White House, with **serious** implications |. If we look at the **headlines**, we might assume that Trump's attacks on American universities are focused on **elite** institutions like Harvard, Columbia, and Tufts, where students have been **arrested** and administrators have been pressured to comply |. However, this **narrative** obscures the more **insidious** actions being taken against the colleges that serve the **bulk** of students in the US and those who come from India |.
