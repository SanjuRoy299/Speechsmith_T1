Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to launch Grade AI Academy, which **bridges** the gap between **theoretical** learning and **practical** experience |. Through our **partnerships** with various MSME clients, we offer a unique opportunity for **professionals** and **industry experts** to **advance** their careers in AI |. We invite you to visit our **state-of-the-art** offline office and academy, where you can witness our work with cutting-edge AI devices, such as Redaxa and Jetson Nano, and explore our applications in traffic enforcement using **advanced** radar technology, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar |. This launch is not just about another learning experience, but about **immersive** experimentation, where learners will **collaborate** with business owners, guided by our **expert** mentors, to develop innovative AI solutions that **address real-world problems** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time** data, which we use to develop low-level ML **architectures** and leverage LLMs and AI to drive **meaningful** impact |. We are committed to a cycle of **research**, **iteration**, and **innovation**, which allows us to **refine** our approach and **push** the boundaries of what is possible with AI |. If you are **interested**, please reserve your spot by clicking the link and join us for upcoming **fellowship** programs, **informative** articles, and **in-depth** case studies |. Let's **connect** and stay updated on our **latest developments**.
