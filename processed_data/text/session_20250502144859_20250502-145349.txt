Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical learning** and **practical experience** |. Through our **partnerships** with various MSME clients |, we invite **professionals** and **industry experts** to visit our **state-of-the-art facilities** |, where they can witness firsthand how we **leverage** cutting-edge AI devices like **Radxa** and **Jetson Nano** to drive **innovation** in **traffic enforcement** using **radar technology**, including 2D, 4D, and 3D **radar** |. This launch is not just about another **learning experience** |, but about **immersive experimentation** where **learners** will **collaborate** with **business owners** and our **experts** to **co-create** solutions that **address real-world challenges** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time data** and **low-level ML architecture solutions**, which enable us to **harness** the power of **LLMs** and AI |. We **embrace** a **culture of experimentation**, where we **research**, **prototype**, **test**, and **refine** |. This approach allows us to **push** the boundaries of what is possible with AI and **drive meaningful impact** |. If you're **interested** in being part of this **journey**, please **register** by clicking the **link** and **reserving your spot** |. Stay **updated** on our **upcoming fellowship programs**, **articles**, and **case studies** |. Thank you for your **attention**.
