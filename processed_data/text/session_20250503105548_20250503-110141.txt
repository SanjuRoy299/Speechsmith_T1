The reality is that it's not the **Ivy** League universities that are most affected, but rather the **smaller** US institutions that provide degrees to the majority of students from India and America |. These universities are facing a far **greater** threat from the White House, with **significant** implications |. While the **headlines** often focus on **prestigious** institutions like Harvard, Columbia, and Tufts, where the administration has taken **drastic** measures, including **arresting** students and demanding **unwavering** obedience from administrators |, the true impact of these actions is being **overlooked** |. The administration's policies are having a profound effect on the colleges that serve the majority of students in the US and those who come to the US from India, and it's **essential** that we bring attention to this issue |.
