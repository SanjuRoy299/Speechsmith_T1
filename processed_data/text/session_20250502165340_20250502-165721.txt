Hi **colleagues** |, I am **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, where we are **revolutionizing** the way we learn by **bridging** the gap between **theoretical learning** and **practical experience** |. Through our **collaboration** with various MSME clients |, we are creating an **immersive experience** for **professionals** and **industry experts** who want to **leverage** AI to **advance** their careers |. Our **state-of-the-art** offline office and academy will provide a **hands-on** environment where you can explore the latest edge AI devices, such as Radxa and Jetson Nano |, and discover how we are **applying** radar technology, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar, to **real-world problems** like traffic enforcement |. This launch is not just about **learning** |, but about **experimenting** and **innovating** |. Our **expert** mentors will guide you in **collaborating** with business owners to **identify** use cases and **develop** AI-powered solutions that **drive impact** |. At the **core** of our approach is **real-time data** and **low-level ML architecture solutions** |, which enable us to **push** the boundaries of what is possible with AI |. We are **committed** to a **cycle** of **research**, **implementation**, **iteration**, and **continuous improvement** |. If you are **interested** in being part of this **journey**, please **reserve** your spot by clicking the link and **staying updated** on our upcoming **fellowship programs**, **articles**, and **case studies** |.
