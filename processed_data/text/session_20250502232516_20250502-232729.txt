Hi **colleagues** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical** learning and **practical** experience |. We have **partnered** with various MSME clients to create a unique learning environment |. Our goal is to attract **professionals** and **industry experts** who want to **leverage** AI to **advance** their careers |. We invite you to visit our **state-of-the-art** offline office and academy |, where you can witness our work with cutting-edge AI devices like Redaxa and Jetson Nano |. We are using **radar** technology, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar, to **revolutionize** traffic enforcement |. This launch is not just about another **learning** experience |; it's about **hands-on** experimentation |, where learners will **collaborate** with business owners, **experts**, and **peers** to develop innovative AI solutions that **address real-world problems** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time** data, which we use to develop **low-level** ML architecture solutions and **leverage** LLMs and AI |. We are committed to **research**, **iteration**, and **continuous improvement** |. As we **push** the boundaries of AI, we are reminded of the importance of **fundamental research** and **practical application** |. If you're **excited** about this opportunity, please **reserve your spot** by clicking the link and **staying updated** on our upcoming **fellowship** programs, **articles**, and **case studies** |.
