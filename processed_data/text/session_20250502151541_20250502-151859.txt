Hello **everyone** |. Today, we are **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grad J Academy |, an innovative platform that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical** learning and **practical** experience |. We have **partnered** with various MSME clients to provide a unique **hands-on** experience |. Our **state-of-the-art** offline office and academy offer a chance to explore the latest **edge AI devices**, such as Redaxa and Jetson Nano, and discover how we're applying **radar technology** to **traffic enforcement** using 2D, 4D, and 3D radar |. This launch is not just about another learning experience |; it's about **immersive** learning, where you'll **collaborate** with business owners, **experts**, and peers to develop **real-world** solutions using AI |. Our **core strength** lies in **real-time data analytics**, where we're working on **low-level ML architecture solutions** and leveraging LLMs and AI to drive **innovation** |. We're committed to a **cycle of research**, **implementation**, **iteration**, and **improvement** |. As we **push** the boundaries of AI, we're reminded of the importance of **fundamental research** and understanding the **why** behind what we're building |.
