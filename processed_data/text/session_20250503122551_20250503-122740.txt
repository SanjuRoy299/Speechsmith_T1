Hi **colleagues** |, I am **thrilled** to announce the launch of Grade AI Academy |, an initiative that **bridges** the gap between **theoretical** learning and **practical** experience |. We have **partnered** with various MSME clients | to create a unique learning environment |. Our **offline** academy offers a hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI devices like Radxa and Jetson Nano |, as well as **radar** technology, including 2D, 4D, and 3D radar |. This launch is not just about **learning** |, but about **experimenting** and **collaborating** with industry experts | to build innovative AI solutions that **matter** |. Our **foundation** is built on **real-time** data and **low-level** ML architecture solutions |, leveraging LLMs and AI to drive **impact** |. We **research**, **implement**, **learn** from our **mistakes**, and **iterate** |. This approach allows us to **push** the boundaries of what is possible with AI | and **drive** meaningful **change** |. If you are **interested**, please reserve your spot by clicking the link and **registering** |. We will **keep you updated** on our upcoming **fellowship** programs, **articles**, and **case studies** |. Thank you for your **attention** |.
